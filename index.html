                <p>The Emperor of Mankind is the immortal ruling monarch of the Imperium of Man, and is described by the Imperial Ecclesiarchy and the Imperial Cult as the Father, Guardian and God of humanity. The Chaos Gods and the daemons of the Warp refer to Him as "the Anathema" for He is the greatest embodiment of universal Order in the galaxy today. He has sat immobile, his body slowly crumbling, within the Golden Throne of Terra for over 10,000 standard years. Although once a living man, His shattered, decaying body can no longer support life, and it is kept intact only by the cybernetic mechanisms of the Golden Throne and a potent mind itself sustained by the daily sacrifice of thousands of lives. The Emperor chose to sacrifice His immortal life at the end of the Horus Heresy in the service and protection of Mankind. To humanity's countless trillions across the galaxy-spanning Imperium, He is nothing less than God. Through his Imperium, Mankind is united and remains one of the most powerful intelligent races in the Milky Way Galaxy as well as its most dominant in terms of both population and territory held. United under one government, Mankind is able to survive the myriad deadly threats it faces from aliens, the Forces of Chaos and the Traitors, Heretics and mutants that lie within the Imperium's boundaries. The Imperium's rule, carried on in the Emperor's name since the end of the Horus Heresy by the High Lords of Terra and a multitude of Imperial organisations, has been long, oppressive and necessarily harsh. It has also resulted in technological and cultural stagnation, and a regression into tyranny, superstition and religious obfuscation and intolerance that would have horrified the Emperor.</p>

            	<p>?-30,000 A.D: Before the Great Crusade
				Not much is written about the God-Emperor from this time. What little is known is that at some point in the ancient past the sages and wise men of the world realized that that they were losing their ability to reincarnate. These early psykers (beings with psychic abilities) realized that without their presence humanity would surely be doomed by the growing power of chaos so they came up with a plan: to take part in a mass ritual suicide and reincarnate as a single being who would have the power to lead humanity through it's darkest hours.

				In around 8 B.C. The God Emperor was born in what is currently Turkey. From there he'd take part in humanity, disguising himself as many different important people to ensure humanity was kept on track and not allowed to stray too far into the dark. This immortal worked behind the scenes to keep humanity marching forward and eventually the whole of humanity had reached a true golden era.

				Unfortunately when humanity was finally starting to colonize the stars disaster struck as massive storms in the Warp (an alternate dimension used to travel faster than light) made it impossible to travel between systems and even made communication impossible. To make things worse, much of the technology man had created in the form of artificial intelligence rebelled. The broken fragments of man were scattered and broken, many worlds reduced to a feral state, forced to live primitive lives. 

				It was time for the Emperor to finally step out of the shadows to reunite mankind.</p>

                <h5>The Unification Wars</h5>

                30,000 A.D.: The Unification Wars
				The Emperor knew that to bring mankind back together he'd need more than just his abilities as a Psyker and eons of knowledge, he'd need an army. 

				He started with the Thunder Warriors: incredible genetically modified humans who were stronger, faster, tougher and harder to kill than a normal man. They served as his original army as he sought to unite humanity on Terra under a single banner. And after several bloody decades of fighting the techno-barbarian warlords of the war and bringing them under his control victory was finally achieved.

				But all was not well: the Thunder Warriors were largely dangerous and unstable and now that peace had finally been reached they had to be killed before things could get worse. Because of this the Emperor had the Thunder Warriors killed. The culling didn't work completely as planned as a few escaped their intended fate. The ultimate fate of these surviving members of the Thunder Warriors is unknown, but what is known is what came after them.

				It was from here the Emperor took everything he had learned over the eons, and with the Thunder Warriors and applied it to 20 new creations made from his own DNA. These 20 sons were created to be reflections of himself, each designed to be a highly intelligent and capable leader as well as just as durable, and potentially as immortal, as the Emperor himself. But there was no true respite for the Emperor just yet as the forces of Chaos stole away the developing children and scattered them across the galaxy.

				Decimated by the loss of his children the Emperor took the remaining samples of the children and using their genes combined the template of the Thunder Warriors with the lost children to create a more mass produced version so that even if one would fall or disappear there would be more to take his place. They weren't as powerful as the lost children, but they possessed the same long lifespan, the same durability and the same keen minds as the children were designed to have. These would become the Adeptus Astartes. These Space Marines would be his hammer and his blade against the darkness of the universe.

                	The man who would later become known as the Emperor of Mankind first appears in Imperial records as just one of the many warlords struggling for control of Terra during the later part of the Age of Strife in the 30th Millennium. The Emperor undertook a series of military campaigns against all the other warlords on the planet that would collectively later become known as the Unification Wars. During these conflicts the Emperor employed several military formations -- such as the genetically-altered warriors of the unit designated Geno 5-2 Chiliad who would go on to serve in the Imperial Army -- that consisted of using genetically-enhanced warriors to maximise His tactical prowess. The most powerful of these troops were the proto-Astartes known as the Thunder Warriors. These warriors played a significant role in the Emperor's eventual victory over all the other warlords of Terra and led Him to believe that His future plans to reunite Mankind would require the creation of an even more potent core of genetically-engineered military commanders and warriors. Following the Battle of Mount Ararat in the Kingdom of Urartu, which was the last battle of the Unification Wars, the Unity of Terra was at last achieved after decades of blood, loss and fire. With this victory, the planet and population of Terra were at last unified under the single rule of the Emperor. But to make His dream of reuniting all of Mankind within a single galaxy-spanning empire possible, the Emperor knew that He would have to make some difficult, even immoral decisions.

					Their purpose having been achieved, the Emperor ordered all of the remaining Thunder Warriors to be liquidated, as they were a dangerous group of men to leave alive in a time of peace and they needed to be removed to make way for their eventual successors, the Primarchs and the Space Marines. Official Imperial propaganda proclaimed that the Thunder Warriors had heroically died to the last man during the Battle of Mount Ararat, the greatest of their number, Arik Taranis, surviving just long enough to raise the Emperor's banner when victory, and unity, was achieved. But the Emperor could not wipe away the stain entirely, for several Thunder Warriors managed to escape what they called the Culling, including Arik Taranis, who would yet have a role to play in the fate of the Emperor's realm.

					The Emperor next set in motion His plan to defend and better Mankind across the galaxy, by unifying those lost bastions of humanity scattered across the myriad stars under the aegis of the newborn Imperium. This extraordinary undertaking would become known as the Great Crusade.

					The Emperor prepared extensively for the Great Crusade in the years after Unity was achieved on Terra; He created the special astro-telepath (Astropath) corps to link his eventual interstellar dominion together through the use of telepathy, and engineered the creation of the Astronomican, a supremely powerful psychic navigational beacon powered by the Emperor's own will and psychic abilities that would allow simplified and safer interstellar travel through the Warp across far greater distances than before. Chief amongst His designs, however, was the creation of new legions of superhuman, genetically-engineered warriors, the logical extension of the gene-troopers already under his command, though they would be far superior to the gene-enhanced troops of the Imperial Army He had used during the Unification Wars. The Emperor first undertook the Primarch Project, the creation of 20 superhuman infants whose genomes had been designed using His own genetic code as the foundation, who were intended to mature into powerful generals and statesmen for His armies. The Primarchs would be beings of such great mental and physical superiority that nothing merely human could stand against them.

					During the Crusade he found the first of his lost children, Horus Lupercal. The lost son was welcomed as the Primarch of the Legion that had adopted the name the Luna Wolves and served as the Emperor's most trusted general, even as other Primarchs were found. Eventually all twenty Legions was headed by a Primarch and the galaxy was being reclaimed in the name of humanity.

					It's not clear what happened to the Primarchs of the 2nd and 11th Legions during this time, but whatever it was had lead to a gag order that not even the Primarchs themselves felt capable of disobeying. During this time psykers were also banned from the Legions, the Word Bearers Legion was censored for it's proliferation and both it and it's Primarch Lorgar were forced to kneel in the ashes of a world they had claimed a year prior and had converted to a religion that Lorgar had declared The Imperial Truth. Things were not easy in the Legions but despite that the Great Crusade was coming along smoothly.

					As the campaign ground on the Emperor began to set his eyes once again on preparing humanity for the future and handed control of the Crusade to Horus whom he declared the Warmaster. Confident that Horus would be able to continue the Crusade he returned to Terra to work on a project to allow humanity to no longer be bound by needing to travel through the Warp.

            	Sadly the project was never to be completed for during this time Horus was tainted by the powers of Chaos and in his attempted to warn his father of the betrayal Magnus broke the psychic barrier that had protected the project allowing a multitude of other-dimensional beings called the Never-born or Daemons. It was only through the psychic might of the Emperor that the creatures back and sealed the gate. 

				But this wasn't enough to turn the growing tide of Chaos as Horus had brought together several legions of Space Marines and his brothers against the Emperor. This resulting conflict would later be called the Horus Heresy. The Horus Heresy was a galaxy-spanning civil war that consumed the worlds of Mankind for 7 Terran years. Its outbreak marked the end of the Emperor of Mankind's Great Crusade to reunite the scattered colony worlds of humanity under a single government and the beginning of the current Age of the Imperium. The Horus Heresy is in many ways the founding event of the Imperium of Man as it now exists. The conflict was fought across the Milky Way Galaxy in the early centuries of the 31st Millennium and resulted in more than 2.3 trillion dead, 4.6 trillion if one includes the planetary populations purged by the Imperium after the Heresy due to the taint of Chaotic corruption. The Heresy concluded with the death of the traitorous Warmaster Horus, the internment of the Emperor in the Golden Throne and the creation of the Chaos Space Marine Traitor Legions. The Heresy was directly responsible for the birth of the present-day structure of the Space Marine Chapters following the Second Founding and the Reformation of the Imperium by the Ultramarines' Primarch Roboute Guilliman.

                30,000 A.D.:
				The Horus Heresy came to a head on Terra as the forces of the Warmaster clashed with the forces of the Imperium, the whole of the galaxy torn apart by the war as the Imperium was torn between the two sides. 

				It was during this final siege of the Warmaster that the Emperor and one of his loyal sons, Sanguinius, boarded Horus' flagship thanks to a moment when the powerful void shields dropped, allowing the loyalist force to teleport aboard the damned warship.

				It was here that the Emperor tried to stop his son, not through force at first, but when the traitorous Warmaster, fueled by the dark forces of Chaos destroyed Sanguinus, and tore the Emperor's arm off, that the Emperor had finally had enough.

				Using his psychic might the Emperor didn't kill Horus, but rather unmade him. Horus the Warmaster was no more, his soul scrubbed from reality and his body reduced to nothing. It was with this that the Seige of Terra, and the Horus Heresy was broken.

				But not all was well. The Emperor had been gravely injured by Horus and was finally dying. With the last of his strength he was interned onto a massive device he had created to help him in his project to create another way for humanity to travel: the Golden Throne. Thanks to this device his body was kept alive as his mind projected his psychic might to act as a beacon for humanity to travel the Warp by as well as a means in protecting Terra from the still broken psychic defenses that had allowed the Daemons to infiltrate the Imperial Palace before.ad developed artificial intelligence, these worlds' populations were simply exterminated outright as potential dangers to the entire body politic of the newborn Imperium.

                	The Emperor remains immobile still, maintaining a silent vigil on the Golden Throne, his body slowly decaying as the Golden Throne is starting to break down after 10,000 years of constant use. It's only through the sacrifice of the souls of a thousand psykers a day that the Emperor's psychic might is able to continue to maintain his damaged soul.

					It's not clear what the fate of humanity will be if the Golden Throne fails completely. Some think that the Emperor's soul will finally be free of the confines of his mortal body, becoming a new god called the Star Child. Others think he will be reborn again to once again lead humanity to a new Golden Age. Others still believe that if he were to truly die then the only thing that would remain for humanity is death and darkness.

					The future of humanity is unclear, but while the God Emperor sits on the Golden Throne there will remain a beacon for humanity to look to in the darkness.
